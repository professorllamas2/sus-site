								<p>It was dark and silent in the room of Yellow and Black.

Yellow was propped up in bed, breathing quietly. As quietly as possible, in fact. Black was still asleep, and Yellow was very focused on not waking him up.

But he was also pretty damn focused on the tent in his boxers.

It had been quite a few months since they launched the ship. And quite a few months can do something to a man.

Yellow was immeasurably horny. So, when he woke up to a mini pants-party, he figured he’d just deal with it quickly and try to go back to bed.

Yellow tugged the old sheet up to his chest and reached silently underneath it. He couldn’t see down there, but he didn’t need to. Soon enough, he found his burning erection.

His gaze darted across the room to where Black slept. The Imposter was snoozing peacefully, but Yellow was still wary. Did Imposters even sleep? They were aliens after all, so maybe they didn’t need to. That possibility scared Yellow more than anything else could have at that moment.

He held his breath and tried to shake out the stressful thoughts. Then, he focused again.

Yellow carefully started rubbing himself through the thin fabric of his boxers, which were soaked at this point. He stifled a moan and his gaze once again flicked across the room, then back. He continued to slowly massage his length.

Yellow had never been very good at composing himself, neither during normal activities nor sexual ones. Not that he participated in sexual activities very often, but, either way, he was a mess. Small whimpers and moans spilled out of his mouth no matter how hard he tried to keep them in, and he scolded himself in his mind. How could he be so vulnerable? He was sure that if someone such as, say, Black had this problem, they’d handle it much better.

So Yellow bit his tongue as he gently freed his dick from its fabric prison. He felt oddly sticky, he noted, and it grossed him out. But he was this far already, and the idea of putting his boxers back on now really grossed him out. So, with fleeting (possibly coming back to bite him in the ass?) remorse, Yellow wrapped a hand around his length and started fapping (quietly).

If he found it near impossible to keep his moans in before, then it was far past impossible now. He was still conscious of the fact that Black was in the room with him, sure, but in his fucked up mindset, it didn’t seem as important anymore.

Yellow tried desperately to quiet himself, but it was getting more difficult by the second. He was full-on whining at this point, and he knew his volume was quickly becoming dangerous, but he couldn’t help it. It just felt really, really good.

Yellow was starting to arch his back under the covers. The warmth of his own wobbly breath and the tingly feeling enveloping his body and the way his legs were shaking and the feeling of his pumps getting weaker and oh god he was going to orgasm oh god oh god oh

“Oh, Yellow.”

God???

“You’re really bad at trying to hide what you’re doing. Or are you even trying at all?”

Oh, it’s not God. It’s just Black.

OH SHIT IT’S BLACK.

And then, like fucking witchcraft or something, Black was under the covers with Yellow, who whimpered in shame. Guess he wasn’t quiet enough.

Black pinned Yellow down on the mattress, and suddenly, Yellow was quite grateful for the absence of light. He wouldn’t have been able to look at Black without crying or something.

“You’re fucking pathetic.”

“B- Black…” Yellow panted. He didn’t know what else to say. He was so overwhelmingly embarrassed that tears pricked at his eyes. And he didn’t even get to orgasm.

Suddenly, Yellow felt something cold and slimy curl around one of his arms, swiftly pinning it up against the headboard behind him. Half the breath in his lungs escaped his lips. Another tendril wrapped itself around his free arm, causing yellow to pull against it weakly.

The tentacle (?) was stronger than Yellow, of course, and guided his hand by the wrist back down to his still-hard dick. He was still, stunned.

“Go on,” Chuckled Black. “Keep on going. Or did you forget how in the last thirty seconds?”

“I’m…” Yellow breathed unevenly. He was starting to feel lightheaded. “I’m sorry, p- please-”

“What are you sorry about? I, for one, was enjoying the show.”

“Just… just…” Yellow trailed off, and instead of finishing his sentence, he whined incoherently. Black sighed and laughed a little bit under his breath. Then he leaned in.

“If you don’t do it, I’m going to have to do it for you,” He whispered into the crook of Yellow’s neck. Yellow only arched his back in response.

Black used his alien tentacles to restrict Yellow’s movement, but much to the poor crewmate’s surprise, the ones wrapped around his wrist let go and subjected themselves to the shadows. And much to his dismay, an ice-cold hand took their place.

Yellow’s shaking hand was slowly guided to his own erection, and he hesitated. This was the most embarrassing and stomach-twisting thing he’d ever done in his life. And all he could do was beg.

Black prompted Yellow’s hand just a little bit further, and, hesitantly, very hesitantly, Yellow took hold of his dick. He squeezed his eyes shut and whimpered as Black copied him exactly - the Imposter’s freezing hand never left his.

Then, Yellow felt warm breath on his neck.

“I’m not going to do all the work. It’s bad enough having to pin you with these tentacles, Yellow.”

Yellow really hated the way that Black said his name; it made him feel all tingly inside and out and forced bad thoughts into his head. But he was still frozen in place. Maybe he was so scared that he couldn’t move, or maybe he was trembling so much that he was scared to try. Either way, it made Black angry, and he finally did something to get Yellow moving.

Black bit him.

It wasn’t a playful nip or a sensual grind, it was a bite. Black had unsurprisingly sharp teeth, and they dug into Yellow’s neck with a razor-like pain.

“Sh-IT, agh…” Yellow gasped louder than he intended to. He felt warm blood start to drizzle down his neck.

That was when he started jerking off for Black.

The twisted freak on top of him smiled into his collarbone and moved his hand in unison. Yellow couldn’t hold himself back from moaning now.

“Fuckin’ desperate slut…” Black continued to help Yellow get off. “Who knew you’d melt so easily? Say, are you this pathetic for anyone on the ship, or is it just me?”

“S- sto-op it Bl-ack… Nghh… Ah-ahhhh, f- fuck…” Yellow’s moans quickly developed into strangled whines as he was overstimulated, and he wished he had something to bite onto to keep the embarrassing noises inside himself. Black, though, seemed to be enjoying them, and he sped up, forcing Yellow to do the same.

Pretty soon the feeling got to be too much again, and a pit formed in Yellow’s stomach. His legs shook and his eyes rolled back in his head. He panted madly.

“Can’t even form words now? Let me guess, you’re coming already.” Black’s teasing was only making it worse.

“Oh, fuck me, oh sh-it… Bl-ack, Black, fuck, Black, G- God, ghn-”

Yellow cut himself off and he saw white for a good ten seconds before slowly coming back to his senses.

It was only after this that he noticed the blood on his collarbone and the tears streaming down his face. He was shaking so hard he thought he might never be still again, and he wasn’t entirely sure where Black’s now-somehow-gentle voice was coming from.

“You're so good, Yellow, crying for me and everything…” He chuckled darkly. “I love it.”

The tentacles quickly retreated, and Black pulled away from Yellow, who was a fluid-covered panting mess. And then, five simple words were spoken.

“Let’s get you cleaned up.”.</p>

								<p>The loud roaring sound of the spaceship was too deafening for his liking. He crossed his arms as his eyes scanned his surroundings - A small, cramped-up room filled with others that were wearing the same outfit as him… only theirs were in an array of colours; red, orange, pink, purple, white, black, green, lime, yellow, cyan and brown. He looked down and noticed that his outfit is blue.

THUMP!!!

The room shook violently as the spaceship finally touched the ground.

ZASSS!!!

“Alright,” White stood up. “We have finally reached our destination. Let’s get on with our respective tasks.” The rest of the group stood up and followed White as he walked out from the room, chatting excitedly with their partners.

“Hey,” Red waved his hand in front of his face. “Are you coming or what?”

“Who, me?” He pointed towards himself, clearly confused.

“Yes, you.” Red held out his hand. “Like I said, are you coming or what?”

“Err… yes,” he took Red’s hand and stood up.

“Let’s go, Blue.” Red replied, smirking. “We have our own tasks to complete too…”

“Oh yes,” Blue grinned, clearly understood Red’s intentions. “This is going to be fun.”

...

Life on the Skeld was quite boring as everyone had tasks to be completed; card swiping, wire fixing, emptying garbage, O2 filter cleaning, asteroid clearing, sample inspection, data uploading and scan submission – to name a few. Since there are many tasks to be completed, each of them will be assigned to a few tasks that changes daily.

“This is boring,” Blue whispered as he and Red watched Purple and White walking around towards their tasks. “When can we start doing our tasks?”

“Patience,” Red replied, making sure that nobody heard their conversation. “We’ll have our chance later.” As he was about to walk away, Blue pulled his arm.

“Where are you going?”

“Urgh,” Red yanked his arm away. “I’m going to check things out.”

“Why?” Blue scratched his head in confusion. “You wanted to start off without me?”

BONK!!!

“What the hell?” Blue rubbed his head after Red slammed his fist on it. “What’s that for?”

“As a reminder for you not to be so stupid,” Red hissed while looking around cautiously. “I’m not gonna start anything for now. It’s just…” he lowered his voice down and nodded curtly as Pink walked past them with a clipboard in her hands. She nodded and waved cheerfully at them. Blue waved back at her and nodded as she went into a nearby room. “We need to learn their ways of doing things around here. Besides, it’s better than hanging around here, doing nothing. We don’t want any unwanted attention, remember?”

“Well, you’re right.” Blue nodded in agreement. Red did have a point right there. “I guess I should get going too.”

“Try to act normal,” Red whispered before parting ways. “Don’t attract any unwanted attention from them.”

…

As everyone were busy with their respective tasks, Red and Blue also keep themselves “busy” by following the crewmates around and learning their ways of doing their tasks around the Skeld.

It was really awkward at first, following the other Crewmates and observing their ways while trying not to appear suspicious at the same time. Blue did ask Red about the purpose in doing such observations and Red’s reply was:

“It makes us blending in easier among them as they wouldn’t suspect anything unusual about us.”

After a while, Blue agreed that Red was right all along. By watching them going places and finishing their tasks, he could slowly learn to do their tasks too. At the same time, both Red and Blue also keep an eye on the Crewmates that looked weak or careless enough while searching for special blind spots all over the Skeld.

…

A week later…

“Have you done your tasks today, Blue?” Red looked up from his map when Blue entered their quarters.

“Oh yes,” Blue nodded. “Lights and Comms.”

“Ahh,” Red gave him a thumbs up. “Good job, Blue. It would be quite awhile for them to get them alright again.”

“What about you, Red?” Blue asked as he settled down in his bed. “Got any tasks today?”

“Nope, I’ll do mine tomorrow.” Red flashed a sly smile. “I think I’ll check out the doors.”

“Great,” Blue clapped his hands. “I guess I’m on observation duty tomorrow.”

“Yeah, that’s a good idea.” Red nodded. “Remember our promise, Blue.”

“I will. You too, Red.”

								<p>It’s not an easy job. No one ever told you it would be.

Living in a spaceship meant to be always on the move except for rare stops to refuel and gather enough crewmates to keep things running smoothly is as complicated as it sounds. You have to be constantly checking the reactor for possible leaks or overheating; to run medical diagnosis at the medbay; to download data from one computer to another; and even to grab the weapons dock’s joystick and explode a cloud of meteors that might cause damage to your ship. It’s a complex job that demands the ability to keep your cool under pressure, to be a good team player, and to trust others to keep you safe.

But as difficult as it is, there’s always something that can make it worse.

That something came to you with the loud blaring of klaxon sirens and the pulsing of red lights just when you were walking down the hallway to the shields’ room. Your communicator buzzed on your utility belt, letting out a crewmate’s voice muddled by static:

“I found a body! White… White is dead!”

Your eyes go wide under your helmet, and your knees threaten to give. What? Someone had killed a crewmate?! Oh no, no, no… You’ve heard of this before. Stories about ships that carried imposters disguised as crew. The Imposters would often kill the crew one by one until only a single crew member was left, and no one knew what was done to that poor last person standing, most theories ranging from them being brutally tortured and killed, eaten alive, or being sent out of the airlock just for the imposters’ dark amusement.

Your stomach churns at that. No… You don’t wanna be killed by these monsters. You draw in a deep breath, forcing yourself to walk down the hall towards the cafeteria. Maybe you could get some information on who could be the impostor.



You take your sit at the round table at the cafeteria, at the right side of Black, who’s already sitting there along with Pink and Brown. Pink’s shoulders are shaking, and she sniffles quietly. Brown is the first to speak.

“Okay, since Red is here we could start talking. Pink, where did y-”

“We’re here.” a deep voice says, and you turn your head to see Blue walk in, followed close by Green, who sits next to Brown; Blue takes his sit by your other side “What happened, who called this meeting?”

Brown took a moment, helmet facing at Blue for a moment like she’s staring at him, sounding mildly annoyed like he had rudely interrupted her.

“Pink did. She found a body.” Brown placed a hand on Pink’s shoulder, thumb stroking her gently “Tell us what you saw, please.”

Pink placed a hand over her helmet where her mouth would be, like that could help her muffle her sobs. Her voice was cracking and punctuated by tiny sniffles.

“I-I was heading for the O2 room when I found White on the floor. He was… was sliced in half all the way through… there was so… much… blood, everywhere. Something did that to him, something… not human! I- I can’t imagine any of us being capable of-”

She dissolved into a long wail while you and the others shared concerned looks. The helmets made it impossible to read someone’s expression. You had to follow your impressions on their character by their actions prior to the murder and their words alone.

“Did you see anyone?” Green asked hopeful

“N-No…” Pink sniffled “Just the b-body…”

“I heard from a buddy in a previous mission that Impostors can enter vents and leave a room without a trace after killing someone.” Black said tensely

“I heard that too.” you agree, looking down at your own interlocked fingers over the grey surface of the table, staring at the red gloves that covered them

Pink was right, no human could slice another clean with their bare hands; did that mean that the Impostors weren’t human? In that case, what were they? You squeeze your eyes shut, refusing to think about the terrifying monsters stories they would tell late at night at the first spaceship you were stationed as a rookie.

“Okay, everyone.” Brown calls, snapping you out of your thoughts “Where were each one of you?”

“I was near the reactor.” Black states flatly “Keeping an eye on the damn thing because it kept getting hotter and hotter and I wanted to be there if it overheated so that I could take care of it.”

“I walked in there for a moment before going to admin” Green adds “He’s telling the truth.”

“I was at Navigation trying to chart a course, but Pink’s alert interrupted me.” Brown states “What about you, Red?”

You stutter a bit in your tension.

“Righbneeth-” you clear your throat “Sorry – right beneath you. I was in shields.”

Brown does that same thing, staring at you without moving. It’s scary, and you turn your face to look away.

“I-I was in O2, like I said” Pink says, seeming to finally be able to speak without crying “I walked right past… you.” She raises a finger to point at blue

All faces turn to blue, and Green is the first to ask what you are thinking.

“Wait, you were leaving O2? Right after-?”

“No!” Blue cuts him off sharply “I wasn’t ‘leaving O2’, I just walked past Pink by the hall on the opposite direction. Pink?”

Pink takes a moment before nodding.

“Yeah, he’s… he’s right, I just walked past him.”

“Then why did you say it like that?” Black asks, to then add with a gentle tone “Pink, if you think anyone’s suspicious, you should be honest and tell us everything.”

“There’s nothing to tell!” Pink exclaims nervously, but apparently the damage of her words is already done, because Green huffs, staring at the ticking numbers that glow on the corner of his tablet’s screen

Every meeting had a limited time for discussing the facts and voting. That prevented meetings from getting too drawn out and people to just start randomly accusing one another out of their own personal feelings. Voting should be concise and fast, and if you didn’t have all the facts, you should abstain from voting rather than try to make up reasons why someone was suspicious.

“Listen.” Green says “White got killed. I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t wanna get killed. The best thing we do is to get rid of the Impostor as fast as we can. That said, Blue is sus.”

Sus is the job’s lingo for suspicious. Since time is of the essence, it was best to keep conversations concise and quick.

You blink, opening your hands in the most universal gesture for ‘what?’.

“Why would you say that?”

Green turned to you.

“Because Pink has relevant information about him possibly leaving the murder scene, and because someone here is an impostor, and we need to vote them out before they kill us!”

You scoff in horror and disbelief.

“I’m scared about the Impostor too, Green! But those aren’t grounds for shooting a human being out of the airlock!”

“Yeah?” Green shoots back, gesturing angrily “What if that isn’t a human being and I’m saving everyone’s asses?!”

“‘What if’ isn’t enough for me to potentially kill a crewmate!” you shake your head “I’m skipping this vote.”

There is silence for a moment as the countdown continues, and Brown points a finger at you.

“What if there’s more than one Impostor? If Red and Blue are Impostors, it would make sense for her to be defending him so fiercely.”

Your mouth drops open in shock and you get up, feeling anger bubbling in your chest.

“I'm defending him because you people want to airlock anyone regardless of having no proof!”

Brown gets up sharply as well, but before they can say a word Black slams a fist on the table.

“Enough! Get down, both of you. Brown, you are as sus as anyone else for being so eager to airlock someone when we have no evidence.” He raises his hands tiredly “I’m skipping as well. I don’t want blood on my hands.”

Pink puts her hand down on the table.

“I’m skipping as well. I know what happened with White was horrible… but throwing any of you out without proof would be just as horrible.”

Green looks from Blue to you and lastly to Pink, sighing.

“Okay, I’ll skip as well.”

“So we all skip and allow a killer to hide in our midst?!” Brown asks, sounding shocked

You shrug at them.

“It’s not ideal, I know. I guess we’re all just gonna have to keep our eyes peeled.”

The six of you walk up to the airlock chamber, each one of you entering a different glass tube and watching its door slide with a pneumatic hiss as it seals shut. A large screen displays everyone’s votes, showing that you all chose to skip this round. The doors hiss open again, and you step out sighing in relief.

If a crewmate is outvoted, the floor beneath their chamber would open, dropping them out in space. Since no one knew how to kill the impostors, that was the solution found by the Space Alliance to get rid of them while also giving a chance to innocent crewmates that were ever wrongfully voted – they could use their suit’s oxygen autonomy and the propulsor jetpacks to try and fly towards another ship and ask to be rescued.

No one turned their backs on rescuing a crewmate adrift in space because most ships were running with a reduced crew and in need of help; this, however, also brought the risk of people bringing in Impostors on accident. Life in space is a gamble, all of it, but this is the riskiest one because you could easily end up paying the ultimate price.

“Okay.” Green says, rubbing the back of his neck like he’s trying to ease out some of the tension there “Everyone get back to your stations… We have plenty of tasks to attend to.”

All of the crewmates scatter in opposite directions, looking forward to being away from the potential killer. You walk up to black, placing a hand on his shoulder.

“Hey… thanks for defending me. I was afraid they would throw me out.”

Black shrugs, voice sounding mildly pleased.

“Hey, don’t worry. Just don’t want anyone to get hurt without proof.”

“Thanks.”

Black nods and turns away, leaving you alone for a moment; You glance at your tablet, checking out your tasks. Looks like there’s low Oxygen supply, and everyone else is busy with other tasks. You swallow down and start marching down the hall, trying to be mentally prepared for what you may find in there.

When you get in the O2 room, you purposefully keep your gaze from the white-and-red mess that is White’s corpse on the floor, thanking the cleaning robot that scoop up their upper torso for later ejection while two smaller robots take care of sweeping the entrails and scrubbing the blood off the floor. Instead, you busy yourself with filling the O2 canisters, wondering which one of you could possibly be the Impostor.

You’re about to reach for the third canister when the lights go out.

“Shit, shit, shit!” you hiss, slamming the power button on the flashlight clipped to your belt, sighing in relief when the thing casts a wide yellow light in front of you

“Someone fucked with the power!” comes Brown’s voice in your comm device “I’m heading there to fix it. Someone take a look at the reactor, it’s getting hot too!”

The reactor is near electrical. Maybe you could go fit it and meet brown nearby and you could watch each other’s back.



You walk down one of the hallways, cursing the low lights and the eerie silence. It’s so scary to be alone in a vessel with a killer that looks like any of you. You turn a corner, wondering when will someone stab you in the back before you can even-

You hear voices ahead, stopping by the corner of the hallway and listening in to their conversation. Through the filters of your helmets, all voices sound a bit similar, and you can’t make out which one are these two by their voices alone.

“Why didn’t you just let them keep accusing Red of being sus?! The more of them that gets airlocked, the safer we are!”

“I don’t know, I… She’s nice. She saw me fumbling a task and instead of running to the others to accuse me she just did it for me instead.”

“You’re putting our mission at risk.”

“Let’s just see how things go, okay? Relax already. It’s not like any of them knows who is the impostor.”

You start walking towards the voices down the hall in one of the rooms. Someone that fumbled a task and you helped… this could be anyone. You know how some of the machines are tricky, and you like helping others. Pink couldn’t slide her keycard fast enough and you did. Blue wasn’t fast enough with the joystick so you shot some asteroids for him. You help people a lot; maybe that’s your mistake? You pick up your keycard, unlocking the door and walking in as soon as the sliding doors part enough to allow you entrance, and that’s when the lights come back.

You’re in the medbay, and it’s completely empty. You look around the small room, wondering where the two people talking could have gone to, and your gaze falls onto the vent on the floor.

Does that mean that there’s two Impostors in this ship?

As if things weren’t bad enough. You run a hand over your visor, sighing tiredly. There’s no way things can get any worse.

That’s when the alarms start blaring again, and Green screams in the comm:

“Brown’s dead. Meeting, NOW!”



All of you rush into the Cafeteria more or less at the same time, sinking down at the table while your breaths are still labored from running there. Green slaps his hand on the table, voice sharp.

“So. I don’t like throwing accusations, but since things are becoming more and more dangerous, I’m gonna say it. Red is sus.”

You gasp audibly, both angry and scared. How dare he?!

“I’m sus?! What’s your deal, Green?! Are you just gonna throw accusations around until one of us is unjustly airlocked?!”

“Brown was onto you, and now he shows up dead! If that’s not sus then I don’t know what is.”

“Uhh…” Pink raises a hand “I was at Admin, walked in there with Green and we found the body. Where were the rest of you?”

“I was in the medbay. Alone” you say, and immediately regret it. Pink turns to face you.

“Alone again, Red?”

“J-Just because I was alone it doesn’t mean I’m sus! I heard-”

You shut up immediately, hesitating. Will all suspicions on you, suggesting that you heard the Impostors talking would make you sound even more sus. You clear your throat, choosing your next words carefully.

“I heard… a noise there and went to check it out.”

Green tuts, sounding almost amused.

“A ‘noise’ huh? I don’t buy it. Red is sus, and I’m not gonna wait around for her to kill me!” and with that he presses his tablet’s screen, obviously voting for you

“I saw Red. I looked into the medbay from the door and I saw her scanning herself.”

The words, coming from Blue in your support made everyone stare at him. Only you and Blue knew he was lying – but why? Why was he blindly vouching for you?

“So what?” Green growled “Maybe Impostors can do it to, fuck if I care. Red is sus. I’m done, and so is the time. You better vote for her if you wanna live.”

The rest of you glance at the countdown, seeing there’s only twenty seconds left to vote. You look at Pink, your voice cracking with fear and anguish.

“Pink… please don’t airlock me! I don’t wanna die!”

“Don’t listen to her, Pink.” Green urged her “She’s gonna gut me after this, and you’re next!”

“Shut up! Both of you shut up!” Pink screamed in a high-pitched cry, pressing something on her screen

Had she nullified her vote? Had she voted for you? You hover your finger over her name, over Green’s, even over Blue – his lie was strange, regardless of it being positive for you. The timer begins to beep louder, announcing the final seconds. You look around, seeing both Black and Blue pressing their screens without looking at you. You blink your tears away, pressing one of the names thinking about nothing but your self-defense.

The timer buzzes and the four of you get up, walking slowly towards the airlock room. The doors seal behind you and you step into your chamber. Refusing to do so would only get more doubt to be cast upon you, and the crew would ultimately force you into it and airlock you regardless.

You draw a shaky breath as the glass door seals in place, and you turn to look at the large monitor on the wall. The votes are up. Green voted for you, as he so clearly would.

You, Pink and the others voted for Green.

“No… No!” he exclaimed, banging his fists on the glass of his chamber “No! You idiots! I’m not the Impostor! You’re all gonna fucking die! You’re all gonna fucking d-”

Circular airlock beneath him slid open, and the vacuum outside of the ship sucked him out along with his terrifying words. It slid back into place, and all four of you stared deftly at the empty chamber.

You had voted him out. You had chosen to have this person ejected from your ship to his potential death.

Your stomach churns, bile rising in your throat. You swallow at it, shaking your head as your chamber hisses open. Your mentors had taught you about the possibility of having to vote for your survival when you were a cadet. It’s part of the job. Maybe Green will find another ship and they’ll let him in. It’s okay.

(It’s not okay, though, and you know it. But you either push the guilt away, or you’ll go insane.)



It’s much later when you finally get your last task of the day done. You’re tired, and you think that maybe it would be good to sleep for a little while, maybe just close your eyes and rest. It has been a long day and you lost half of your crew. You walk past admin and see on the map screen that Pink is in the dorms herself. You think about maybe asking her to maybe take turns on sleeping and keeping watch while Black and Blue do their work around the ship.

You walk by the electric room, scowling at the trail of blood that a cleaning robot is attempting to mop off the floor, most likely where Brown had been killed. You make a left, seeking the dorms and the soft bed where you can finally look for a bit or peace and rest. The doors slide open with a hiss, and you step into the room. There’s a person lying on the lower bunk at the far end of the room, and you refrain from turning the lights on.

“Pink? Are you asleep?” there is no response, and you sigh “Pink, I feel so bad for sending Green out of the airlock. I just hope I did the right thing.”

You hear a strange noise, and the form on the bed shifts some. The same noise comes again, a wet sound that reminds you of someone sinking their teeth into a ripe fruit. A shiver creeps up your spine, a bad feeling that squeezes your chest tightly as you hastily flick the light switch on.

Your eyes have mere seconds to register the entirety of the gruesome scene. Pink lies on the bed on her back, a large circular wound in her stomach. Something had tore through her suit, flesh and muscle, and her torso was drenched in blood that had seeped through the bedsheets and dripped down to the floor in a horrendous red puddle by one of the bedposts.

The thing that had pierced through her is still being slowly pulled out from inside her, a long, thick, fleshy thing that could be only described as a tentacle, coiling like a snake as it retreated back into... Blue’s torso?!

Blue had been bending over Pink, and the red tentacle slowly sinks into his middle until it’s gone. Blue lazily stretches his neck, rubbing it some with his hand as if it hurts from having being bent down for too long. His suit has a large spatter of dark red that goes over his chest, some of it clearly having sprayed on the right side of his helmet and visor.

“Ah, poor, poor Red.” there is some kind of delighted giddiness in his voice “I’m afraid you didn’t do the right thing, no.”



You turn on your heels, bolting out into the hallway, your hand shooting down to pick your comm device and nearly dropping it as you ran towards the engine, pressing the button so hard you might break it.

“BLACK, BLUE IS THE IMPOSTOR!” you bellow into the comm “WE NEED TO HOLD A MEETI- uhn!”

You collide with something solid, falling down on your ass. It’s Black, towering over you as you frantically look around to see if the two of you are near any vents.

“Black!” you sigh in relief “Black, I just saw Blue, he’s-” you can’t bring yourself to describe the horror scene you just witnessed “He’s the impostor, we’re the last humans in the ship and we need to send him out the airlock now!”

Black crosses his arms while you get back to your feet.

“This isn’t how things work. We need to hold a meeting before we think about airlocking people, Red. Where is Pink?”

The question nearly makes you vomit on the spot.

“Pink… Pink is dead. I just saw her.” You squeeze your eyes shut, trying to think “You’re right though. We need to pretend we still trust him… It’s the only way to get him to enter the chamber voluntarily. If we accuse him out of a meeting, he’ll just kill you and I in a second.”

You pat your belt, searching for the comm device. You had it just now. Where is it?

“So, Pink is dead…” Black says pensively

“I need my comm to call upon a meeting!” you say between clenched teeth, patting your suit again and again like it would make it appear on your belt “Have you seen…?”

Black takes a few steps to the left of the place you had bumped on him, and you see your comm very close to him on the floor. Black picks it up and you hold out your hand for him to return it.

“Ah, good, you found-”

CRACK

Black doesn’t flinch as he squeezes the device with unhuman strength into his fist until it breaks like a child’s toy, falling apart on the floor in the shape of loose screws, plastic bits and electronic parts.

“Sorry, Red.” and it almost sounds like he means it “You are outnumbered now.”

No.

You take a step back. Then another.

No, no, no.

You turn around and start running, your heart thudding in your chest and fear tightening your throat. Your steps echo in the empty hallways, pounding on the metallic plates with every messy, desperate stride you take. If you get to the comms room, you might still be able to relay a message and maybe find a ship, any ship nearby and beg for a rescue before-

The lights go out, and you are bathed by the red emergency lights as the klaxon sirens start blaring. Sabotage. Every room is a death trap now, and twice as dangerous in the dark. Your life is in the hands of two Impostors, and you have the nauseating feeling that they want to turn this into some sick game of hide-and-seek.</p>

								<h2 class="major">bitch</h2>
								<p>Pink was sitting in the far corner of electrical, so if you wanted to find him you had to search. He was also sitting on the vent. But no matter. Pink had never been accepted for who he was. Not by his parents, his school, his teachers, anyone. Not even his crew. From the beginning he was shunned because he was trans. Everyone except the captain and Yellow referred to him as she. He hated it. But everyone was dead now. Black, Green, White... everyone. He knew he felt bad, but a small part in the back of his brain also thought of it as karma.



He tucked his legs closer to his chest and cried, the huffs fogging up his helmet. He didn't notice someone come in since he couldn't see from his foggy helmet and the stinging tears in his eyes, and he couldn't hear from the huffs reverberating on the helmet sides. They took off his helmet and he was met with the face of Yellow. He tried to push him away but his arm was grabbed and he was pulled forward onto Yellow's lap. He thrashed until he realized Yellow was simply staring at him.



"If you want to-" A sniff. "Kill me just do it already!" Another. Yellow just stared and let go of his arm to bring him to his chest. He moved his hand up and down Pink's back, something he hadn't felt since before he came out to his parents. He cried more and just held onto the impostor. He realized where he was and who he was holding after he calmed down a bit and cried more.



Yellow brought his head up and rubbed his gloved hand on Pink's cheek. He put his other hand to the small of Pink's back and pulled him closer. His hand traveled a bit down, and Pink jerked. He lifted his hand and put it around his back, nearly reaching the other side, where the small breasts were. Pink was always shorter than the others, as a natural born girl, but he was tall enough to get everything done.



Pink gulped and Yellow moved both of his hands to the former's waist and stared into pinks eyes as he asked a simple question. "Can we make love?" Pink paled. Not only would it be his first time, he didn't really feel comfortable with other people seeing his... anatomy. He sat silent and Yellow simply ran his fingers through Pink's hair.



"I know you're not comfortable with it, but I promise it won't hurt." He seemed sincere, but he did when he said he wasn't the impostor. Pink swallowed again, and looked him in the eyes, "Do you really promise?" Yellow nodded and whispered, "I do my love." into Pink's ear, making him cry again and hug him. Yellow chuckled and picked Pink up bridal style. Pink nearly jumped in shock before realized what happened.



"The bed would be more comfortable than a ground of wires." He walked to the dorms in a smaller part of the ship and set Pink on the bed. "Before we start, are you SURE you want this?" Pink nodded and pouted slightly. "Are you sure? I won't hurt you if you refuse, I'll just let you be." Pink nodded again and pouted more.



Yellow sat between Pink's legs and kissed him, feel the smaller kiss back and open his mouth slightly. He slipped his tongue in and fondle Pink's with his own. He felt Pink moan and lean forward. He pulled away, and smirked at the small whimper that came from Pink. "I want to make this good for your first time. So let me take the lead." He picked the pinkette up and set him on his lap, before slowly licking, kissing, and slightly biting the pale skin.



He loved the whimpers from the smaller crewmate, and slowly turned to lay him on the bed. He started undoing the clasps and zippers on Pink's suit, then undid his. He ran his hands on the baggy clothes that covered Pink's body. He took his own shirt off and started to slip Pink's off, which he was allowed to do. He ran his hands over his chest, which was smooth except for the small raises of breasts. He chuckled as Pink blushed and leaned down to place small love marks on the smaller's chest.



He slipped the rest of his suit and the casual clothes off to see a shocked look on Pink's face. "They're not as bad as they look, trust me." He then walked over and slipped Pink's off. He smiled reassuringly and gave Pink another soft kiss before slipping his (ungloved) hands down to Pink's folds. The former slowly rubbed Pink, watching the different faces he made, and all the little sounds.



Yellow kissed Pink again and got up so he could stand in front of him, slowly prodding and moving his fingers around Pink's folds. He slipped a finger in and Pink let out a small moan. He slowly moved his finger in and out, curling it slightly, making Pink moan louder. He slowly stretched him enough to add a second, then slipped in a third, to which Pink whimpered and hugged his arms to his chest a bit.



The taller moved to give Pink a kiss, getting a moan instead as he moved his fingers farther in as he went to give him a kiss. He chuckled and slowly starting pumping them, reveling in the moans that emerged from Pink. He sat next to him, taking his fingers out and moving him so he was fully on the bed, not with his legs off like before. He didn't put his fingers back in, but spread the shorter's legs and moved a tentacle to his entrance.



"Are you still sure you want to do this? You can back out now." Yellow had a soft smile on his face. A breathless yes and came from Pink's mouth and the tentacle slipped in as he kissed Pink, slowly moving his hands over the raised chest the pinkette had. He smiled and slowly started thrusting faster, until he was going at a pace that had Pink moaning loud enough that you could probably hear him on another ship.



Yellow moved back for breath and fell in love with Pink again as he saw what he thought was the most beautiful fucked out face. Rolled back eyes, mouth wide open with his tongue and moans spilling out, his hands resting on his cheeks, and the perfect blush to top it off. He subconsciously went faster and got more of those moans he loved. He slowed down as he heard his love moan louder than before and saw him close his eyes and he gripped Yellow.



Pink's orgasm felt wonderful. It felt as those he was floating in clouds, but falling from them at the same time. Or if he was floating on water and drowning at the same time. It was magical. He steadied his breathing as much as he could and kissed Yellow. The latter pulled out and brought Pink to his chest. "I love you, my sweet little boy." Pink cried and put his face in the crook of Yellow's neck as he soon fell asleep.



Yellow smiled and brought the blanket up over him and his beloved Pink. "Good night dear."  </p>
